We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)






## Examples

**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-alarms/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "alarm" {
      source                    = "https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-alarms.git"
      name                      = "alarm"
      application               = "clouddrove"
      environment               = "test"
      label_order               = ["environment", "name", "application"]
      alarm_name                = "cpu-alarm"
      comparison_operator       = "LessThanThreshold"
      evaluation_periods        = 2
      metric_name               = "CPUUtilization"
      namespace                 = "AWS/EC2"
      period                    = "60"
      statistic                 = "Average"
      threshold                 = "40"
      alarm_description         = "This metric monitors ec2 cpu utilization"
      alarm_actions             = ["arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxx:test"]
      actions_enabled           = true
      insufficient_data_actions = []
      ok_actions                = []
      instance_id               = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

  }
```



## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| actions_enabled | Indicates whether or not actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm's state. | bool | `true` | no |
| alarm_actions | The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state. | list | `<list>` | no |
| alarm_description | The description for the alarm. | string | `` | no |
| alarm_name | The descriptive name for the alarm. | string | - | yes |
| application | Application (e.g. `cd` or `clouddrove`). | string | `` | no |
| comparison_operator | The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified Statistic and Threshold. | string | - | yes |
| enabled | Enable alarm. | bool | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | string | `` | no |
| evaluation_periods | The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. | number | - | yes |
| instance_id | The instance ID. | string | `` | no |
| insufficient_data_actions | The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state. | list | `<list>` | no |
| label_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | list | `<list>` | no |
| metric_name | The name for the alarm's associated metric. | string | `CPUUtilization` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | string | `` | no |
| namespace | The namespace for the alarm's associated metric. | string | `AWS/EC2` | no |
| ok_actions | The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an OK state from any other state. | list | `<list>` | no |
| period | The period in seconds over which the specified statistic is applied. | string | `120` | no |
| statistic | The statistic to apply to the alarm's associated metric. | string | `Average` | no |
| threshold | The value against which the specified statistic is compared. | string | `40` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN of the cloudwatch metric alarm. |
| id | The ID of the health check. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |



## Testing

In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
